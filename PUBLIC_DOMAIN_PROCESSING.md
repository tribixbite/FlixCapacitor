# Public Domain Movie Processing - Complete

## Summary

Successfully processed all 890 movies from publicdomaintorrents.com catalog with TMDB/OMDb API integration.

## Results

- **Total Movies Processed**: 890
- **High-Rated (≥7.0/10)**: 27 movies
- **Low-Rated (<7.0)**: 667 movies
- **No Metadata Match**: 194 movies

## Processing Details

### API Integration
- Used correct API keys from `.env` file
  - TMDB: `ac92176abc89a80e6f5df9510e326601`
  - OMDb: `a25890ce`
- Rate-limited requests (300ms delay)
- Saved progress every 10 movies for resumability

### Data Enrichment
Each high-rated movie includes:
- TMDB metadata (rating, votes, year, plot, genres)
- OMDb IMDb ratings (for double-checking)
- Verified torrent info hash (extracted from .torrent files)
- HTTP tracker: `http://files.publicdomaintorrents.com/bt/announce.php`
- High-quality posters and backdrop images

## Year Verification and Correction (2025-10-14)

### Issue Discovery
Found that TMDB title search was matching wrong movies - many public domain films have similar titles to modern remakes. For example, "A Star is Born" matched the 2018 version instead of the 1937 original.

### Verification Process
1. Scraped all 27 movie pages from publicdomaintorrents.info
2. Extracted correct IMDB IDs from each movie page
3. Cross-referenced with OMDb API for accurate years
4. Re-fetched TMDB metadata using IMDB ID lookup (more accurate than title search)

### Results
- **Correct Years**: 9 movies
- **Wrong Years Corrected**: 15 movies
- **No Data Available**: 3 movies

### Key Corrections
- A Star is Born: 2018 → **1937**
- City Ninja: 1988 → **1985** (also fixed IMDB ID)
- Jane Eyre: 1997 → **1943**

- Our Town: 2003 → **1940**
- Rock Rock Rock: 2021 → **1956**
- Sunny: 2024 → **1941**
- The Brain That Wouldnt Die: 2020 → **1972**
