# FlixCapacitor Mobile - Current Work Session

## Session Date: 2025-10-15

### Completed Fixes

#### 1. Video Playback Critical Bug ✅
**Issue:** Video playback crashed with "statusText is not defined" error  
**Root Cause:** Race condition where progress callback tried to access `streamInfo` before Promise resolved  
**Fix:** Moved video.src assignment to after stream is ready (line 3297)  
**Commit:** cd16fd4

#### 2. Browse Dropdown Behavior ✅  
**Issue:** Dropdown started expanded and didn't close after selecting Movies/TV Shows/Anime  
**Root Cause:** HTML had "active" class by default, JavaScript kept dropdown active after selection  
**Fix:**
- Removed "active" class from HTML template
- Modified JavaScript to close dropdown after selection
**Commit:** f300e93

#### 3. FAB Position Blocking Settings ✅
**Issue:** Floating action button overlapped with settings navigation item  
**Root Cause:** FAB positioned at bottom: 20px, overlapping 60px-tall navigation bar  
**Fix:** Moved FAB to bottom: calc(10vh + 80px) - 10% screen height above nav bar  
**Commit:** 73573f3

#### 4. File Picker for Multi-File Torrents ✅
**Issue:** No file picker shown for TV shows, learning courses, magnets, or torrent files  
**Root Cause:** showFilePickerModal method was called but never implemented  
**Fix:** Created full file picker modal with:
- Clean mobile UI showing all video files
- File sizes displayed
- "Largest" file indicator  
- Touch-friendly selection
- Works for all multi-file content types
**Commit:** 034a508

**Note:** Currently shows after stream starts (native auto-selects largest). Future enhancement would show picker BEFORE streaming.

### Remaining Issues

**Issue:** Library scan hangs at 0/0 files, doesn't prompt for storage permissions  
**Status:** Not yet investigated

**Issue:** Playing library items results in "no torrent" error  
**Status:** Not yet investigated

**Status:** Not yet investigated
