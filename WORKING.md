# FlixCapacitor Mobile - Current Work Session

## Session Date: 2025-10-15

### Completed Fixes

#### 1. Video Playback Critical Bug ✅
**Issue:** Video playback crashed with "statusText is not defined" error  
**Root Cause:** Race condition where progress callback tried to access `streamInfo` before Promise resolved  
**Fix:** Moved video.src assignment to after stream is ready (line 3297)  
**Commit:** cd16fd4

#### 2. Browse Dropdown Behavior ✅  
**Issue:** Dropdown started expanded and didn't close after selecting Movies/TV Shows/Anime  
**Root Cause:** HTML had "active" class by default, JavaScript kept dropdown active after selection  
**Fix:**
- Removed "active" class from HTML template
- Modified JavaScript to close dropdown after selection
**Commit:** f300e93

#### 3. FAB Position Blocking Settings ✅
**Issue:** Floating action button overlapped with settings navigation item  
**Root Cause:** FAB positioned at bottom: 20px, overlapping 60px-tall navigation bar  
**Fix:** Moved FAB to bottom: calc(10vh + 80px) - 10% screen height above nav bar  
**Commit:** 73573f3

#### 4. File Picker for Multi-File Torrents ✅
**Issue:** No file picker shown for TV shows, learning courses, magnets, or torrent files  
**Root Cause:** showFilePickerModal method was called but never implemented  
**Fix:** Created full file picker modal with:
- Clean mobile UI showing all video files
- File sizes displayed
- "Largest" file indicator  
- Touch-friendly selection
- Works for all multi-file content types
**Commit:** 034a508

**Note:** Currently shows after stream starts (native auto-selects largest). Future enhancement would show picker BEFORE streaming.

#### 5. Library Scan Permissions ✅
**Issue:** Library scan hangs at 0/0 files, doesn't prompt for storage permissions
**Root Cause:** No permission check/request before scanning folders
**Fix:** Added Filesystem permission check and request flow before starting scan:
- Checks current permission status with Filesystem.checkPermissions()
- Requests permissions if not granted
- Shows clear error message if user denies
- Lines 1773-1804 in mobile-ui-views.js
**Commit:** 37792de

#### 6. Library Playback - Local File Support ✅
**Issue:** Playing library items results in "no torrent" error
**Root Cause:** playMovie() method only handled torrent-based playback, not local files
**Fix:**
- Added check for file_path property to detect library items
- Created new playLocalFile() method (lines 2851-2919)
- Uses Filesystem.getUri() to get proper Android file URI
- Includes video player with back button, keep-awake, and proper cleanup
- Lines 2811-2815, 2851-2919 in mobile-ui-views.js
**Commit:** 2573bda

#### 7. Library Folder Filters ✅
**Issue:** Folder filters displayed but had no functionality
**Root Cause:** Filter tabs rendered without click event handlers
**Fix:**
- Added click handlers to filter tabs with active state management (lines 1686-1699)
- Created showLibraryFiltered() method (lines 1764-1853)
- Filters by folder path patterns (/Movies/, /Download/, /DCIM/, /Videos/)
- Shows appropriate empty states for folders with no content
- Handles "All Folders" view to show unfiltered library
**Commit:** fb62a80
