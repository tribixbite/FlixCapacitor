# FlixCapacitor - Next Steps

**Date:** 2025-11-12
**Status:** TypeScript + Tailwind CSS Overhaul Required (BLOCKING)

## CRITICAL: Testing Blocked Until Overhaul Complete

**No device testing or new features until TypeScript strict mode + Tailwind CSS migration is complete.**

See: `TYPESCRIPT-TAILWIND-OVERHAUL.md` for full implementation plan.

**Why This is Critical:**
- Current codebase has `strict: false` (type safety disabled)
- 25 files using `any` types extensively
- 67 inline `.style.` usages (unmaintainable)
- No CSS framework or design system
- Technical debt blocking future development

**Estimated Effort:** 6 weeks (~150 hours)
**Priority:** BLOCKING - Must complete before any testing or new features

---

## Current State

### ✅ Completed

   - Build successful: main-C-mgP9UD.js (585.73 kB)

2. **Video Switching Bug Fixes** (Priority 1 - FIXED ✅)
   - Fixed file picker timing: now shows BEFORE video starts
   - Fixed race condition: stream request tracking prevents wrong video from playing
   - Implementation: currentStreamRequestId validates each stream request
   - Multi-file flow restructured: start→metadata→stop→pick→select→restart
   - Build successful: main-BsodZREa.js (588.35 kB)
   - APK ready: app-debug.apk (74MB)

   - Build completed using ./build-and-install.sh on Termux ARM64

### 🚫 Blocked (Pending Overhaul)
1. **Device Testing**
   - BLOCKED until TypeScript + Tailwind overhaul complete
   - APK likely auto-installed via termux-open
   - ADB device not connected
   - Test suite ready but cannot proceed

2. **New Features**
   - BLOCKED until codebase quality improved
   - All new development paused

## Immediate Priority: TypeScript + Tailwind Overhaul

### Overview

Complete refactor of codebase for:
1. **TypeScript strict mode** with full type safety
2. **Tailwind CSS** for maintainable styling
3. **Mobile-first responsive design**

### Current Technical Debt

**TypeScript Issues:**
- ❌ `strict: false` in tsconfig.json
- ❌ 25 files using `any` types
- ❌ No type safety enforcement
- ❌ IDE autocomplete broken in many places
- ❌ Runtime type errors possible

**Styling Issues:**
- ❌ 67 inline `.style.` usages
- ❌ Only 1 CSS file (animation.css - 905 bytes)
- ❌ No Tailwind CSS installed
- ❌ No design system or component library
- ❌ Unmaintainable string template styling

**Impact:**
- Hard to add new features safely
- Difficult to maintain existing code
- Poor developer experience
- Technical debt accumulating
- Cannot safely test without type safety

### Implementation Plan

See `TYPESCRIPT-TAILWIND-OVERHAUL.md` for complete 7-phase plan:

**Phase 1: TypeScript Strict Mode (Week 1-2)**
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Fix all `any` types with proper interfaces
- Add type guards and null checks
- Estimated: 20 hours

**Phase 2: Tailwind Installation (Week 1)**
- Install Tailwind + plugins
- Create tailwind.config.js
- Create main.css with custom components
- Update Vite configuration
- Estimated: 4 hours

**Phase 3: Convert Inline Styles (Week 2-3)**
- Remove all `.style.` usages (67 instances)
- Replace with Tailwind utility classes
- Convert templates to use Tailwind
- Estimated: 30 hours

**Phase 4: Mobile-First Design (Week 3-4)**
- Responsive grid system
- Touch-friendly components (44x44px min)
- Safe area inset handling
- Estimated: 20 hours

**Phase 5: Dark Mode & Theming (Week 4)**
- Implement dark mode toggle
- Consistent color system
- Estimated: 8 hours

**Phase 6: File-by-File Migration (Week 1-5)**
- 25 TypeScript files to migrate
- One file at a time with testing
- Estimated: 40 hours

**Phase 7: Performance Optimization (Week 5)**
- Purge unused CSS
- Critical CSS inlining
- Estimated: 8 hours

**Total: ~150 hours over 6 weeks**

## Next Steps (AFTER Overhaul)

### Step 1: Connect ADB Device

Choose one of these methods:

**Option A: USB ADB**
```bash
# On device, enable USB debugging in Developer Options
# Connect device via USB
# On Termux:
adb devices

# Expected output:
# List of devices attached
# <device_id>    device
```

**Option B: Wireless ADB**
```bash
# First connect via USB, then:
adb tcpip 5555
adb connect <device_ip>:5555

# Now you can disconnect USB and use wireless ADB
```

**Option C: Local ADB (if testing on same device)**
```bash
# Start ADB server
adb start-server

# Connect to local device
adb connect localhost:5555
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```bash
# Check app is installed
adb shell pm list packages | grep flixcapacitor

# Expected output:
# package:app.flixcapacitor.mobile

# Verify TestActivity exists
adb shell dumpsys package app.flixcapacitor.mobile | grep TestActivity

# Expected output:
# Activity app.flixcapacitor.mobile.TestActivity
```

### Step 3: Run Automated Tests

```bash
# Make test script executable
chmod +x test-adb.sh

# Run full test suite
./test-adb.sh all

# Or run individual tests
./test-adb.sh multifile    # Multi-file playback
./test-adb.sh favorites    # File-level favorites
./test-adb.sh library      # Library folder scanning
./test-adb.sh subtitles    # Subtitle detection

# Monitor logs in real-time (separate terminal)
adb logcat -s FlixTest:D
```

### Step 4: Manual Testing (Alternative)

If automated testing is not available:

```bash
# Launch app
adb shell am start -n app.flixcapacitor.mobile/.MainActivity

# Monitor logs
adb logcat -s VideoPlayer:D PlaybackQueue:D FavoritesService:D
```

Then manually:
1. Navigate to a multi-file torrent
2. Select multiple files (3+ recommended)
3. Click "Play X Files" button
4. Verify queue UI appears top-left
5. Verify first file plays
6. Skip to end of video
7. Verify second file auto-plays
8. Verify queue UI updates to "(2/X)"

## Implementation Summary

### Bug Fixes Implementation

**Stream Request Tracking:**
- Added `currentStreamRequestId: number` to VideoPlayerContext
- Increments on each `showVideoPlayer()` call to track specific requests
- Validates request ID before setting video source
- Prevents old/cancelled streams from overwriting new ones
- Logging format: `[showVideoPlayer] requestId=N`

**File Picker Timing Fix:**
- OLD: Stream started → Picker shown (after video began)
- NEW: Stream started → Get metadata → Stop stream → Show picker → User selects → Restart with selected file
- User makes file selection BEFORE playback begins
- Supports user cancellation (back navigation)
- Request validation after async operations (picker, file selection)

**Race Condition Prevention:**
- Only most recent stream request can set video source
- Check: `if (this.ctx.currentStreamRequestId !== thisRequestId) { return; }`
- Prevents scenario: Click Video B → Video A plays
- Validation at two critical points:
  1. Before setting video source (prevents old stream)
  2. After file picker selection (handles cancellation)

### PlaybackQueue Class
- Manages sequential playback of multiple torrent files
- Tracks current position, total files, file metadata
- Methods: hasNext(), playNext(), getCurrentFile(), getNextFile()
- Stores movie/torrent data for seamless transitions

### Auto-Play Next
- Video 'ended' event handler
- Automatically stops current stream
- Starts next file in queue
- Updates queue UI
- Clears queue after last file

### Queue Status UI
- Top-left overlay with backdrop blur
- Shows "Playing: filename (X/Y)"
- Shows "Next: next_filename"
- Auto-hides for single files
- Updates on transitions

### TestActivity
- Handles flixtest:// deep link intents
- Supports 5 test scenarios
- Logs to logcat with FlixTest tag
- Launches MainActivity with test data
- Provides comprehensive test coverage

fix: prevent old/cancelled stream requests from playing (video switching bug)

Two critical bug fixes for torrent video playback:

1. File Picker Timing Issue
   - BEFORE: Stream started immediately, picker shown after video began
   - AFTER: start→metadata→stop→pick→select→restart flow
   - User now selects files BEFORE playback begins

2. Video Switching Race Condition
   - BEFORE: Rapid torrent switching caused wrong video to play
   - AFTER: currentStreamRequestId tracks and validates each stream request
   - Only most recent request can set video source
   - Old/cancelled requests are ignored

Implementation:
- Added currentStreamRequestId to VideoPlayerContext interface
- Increment ID on each showVideoPlayer() call
- Validate request ID before setting video source
- Restructured multi-file flow for proper picker timing
- Support user cancellation with back navigation

APK Build:
- Successfully built app-debug.apk (74MB)
- Ready for device testing
```
